# Interesting Links (by date)

This page is a bunch of links I got from various newsletters and assorted sources that I think are interesting. 
New links are added as I find them, hopefully ordered by date.

## October 2024

* [Passwords have problems, but passkeys have more](https://world.hey.com/dhh/passwords-have-problems-but-passkeys-have-more-95285df9)  
    I vehemently agree with DHH on this point. My work has started using passkeys and they just make everything more complicated with not clear benefits.
* [Why Gumroad Didn't Choose htmx](https://htmx.org/essays/why-gumroad-didnt-choose-htmx/)  
    I don't hate htmx but I also don't think it fits any of my use cases. Anyway, this article is a good example of how you should actually pick your tools based on your requirements instead of trying to fix every problem with the same tool. People who use React seem particularly intent on using it for _literally everything_.
* [Web Components are not Framework Components — and That's Okay](https://lea.verou.me/blog/2024/wcs-vs-frameworks/)  
    An interesting article by Lea Verou about the past, present, and speculations of the future of web components.


## August 2024

* [Micro-libraries need to die already](https://bvisness.me/microlibraries/)  
    A really good article argumenting against libraries like `left-pad` and `is-number`. Keep a check on your dependencies!
* [Phoenix Code](https://phcode.io/#/home)  
    A nice IDE for web development, with some live debugging features that VSCode doesn't have. On the other hand, it doesn't seem _as_ featureful as VSCode. It also has an online version so you can easily test it.


## July 2024

* [Opinions for Writing Good CSS](https://www.andrewwalpole.com/blog/opinions-for-writing-good-css/)  
    A bunch of generally good guidelines for writing CSS. I agree with most of them, although I'm not sure about avoiding margin and padding.
* [CSS Grid Areas](https://ishadeed.com/article/css-grid-area/)  
    If you are interested in CSS, you probably already know Shadeed. This article gives very clear explanations are real-world examples
    of grid areas. It's a very interesting feature of CSS Grid that's, as far as I know, supported by every browser.


## June 2024

* [Why I retired from the tech crusades](https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-i-retired-from-the-tech-crusades-107a51ea)  
    The best advertisement for your framework or library is making a great product. Trying to convince people to use your tech with just
    words is generally useless.
* [Data ownership and agency](https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/data-ownership-and-agency/)  
    Another anti-social media article. I agree with not just letting large companies have all of your data. I fully support people
    using any tool they can to make their own personal site. It is not even that hard.


## May 2024

* **[The perfect site doesn’t exist](https://branch.climateaction.tech/issues/issue-8/the-perfect-site-doesnt-exist/)**  
    A good motivational article about not worrying too much about getting things perfect and instead getting them _done_ first.
* **[A brief history of web development. And why your framework doesn't matter.](https://gebna.gg/blog/brief-history-of-web-development)**  
    I completely agree with this article; for the most part your choice of framework doesn't matter. The only time it really matters is when you're building a large enterprise project and you need to find maintenance developers in the future.
* [Programming mantras are proverbs](https://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/programming-mantras-are-proverbs/)  
    An interesting way to think about programming mantras. The short of it is, you shouldn't just follow the rules without thinking
    about why you're doing it. Otherwise, you might as well be a generative AI.
* [The New !important](https://geoffgraham.me/the-new-css-important/)  
    An interesting way to manipulate specificity in CSS. using `:not`, you can add a hook to "undo" styling.
* [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev)  
    It's not for me personally, but a free (privacy-conscious) website service is always handy.
* [Free for Developers](https://free-for.dev/#/)  
    An index of free resources for development, including some free BaaS and hosting services.
* [happy-dom](https://github.com/capricorn86/happy-dom)  
    A JavaScript DOM parser. Possible faster alternative for jsdom?


## April 2024

* [What's new in Astro - March 2024](https://astro.build/blog/whats-new-march-2024/)  
    Contains links to some interesting tutorials concering the new Astro DB, including:

    * [How to Build a Views Counter with Astro DB](https://www.vorillaz.com/astro-views)
    * [Going full-stack on Astro with Cloudflare D1 and Drizzle](https://kevinkipp.com/blog/oing-full-stack-on-astro-with-cloudflare-d1-and-drizzle/)
* [Waku](https://waku.gg); a nice minimalistic SSG, like Next.js but a lot smaller.
* [Modern CSS patterns in Campfire](https://dev.37signals.com/modern-css-patterns-and-techniques-in-campfire/)  
    A bunch of nice illustrations on ways to use modern CSS.
* [Wedges](https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/wedges)  
    Although I don't use React too much, this looks like a nice component library. MIT licensed.
* [Front End Developer/Engineer Handbook 2024](https://frontendmasters.com/guides/front-end-handbook/2024/)  
    A nice (and extremely extensive) list of front-end technologies and paradigms to check. By FrontendMasters.


## Before april 2024 (genesis)

* **[100 things you can do on your personal website](https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/19/personal-website-ideas/)**  
    Self-explanatory but contains some pretty cool things I hadn't thought of. This article is one of the things that inspired me to make this list, actually.
* **[Flavio's list of sample Web App Ideas](https://flaviocopes.com/sample-app-ideas/)**  
    Flavio generally makes pretty good articles and sites, and this one has a bunch of nice ideas that seem both interesting and do-able as small projects to test new libraries and frameworks.
* [No Maintenance Intended](https://unmaintained.tech/)  
    A badge for open source projects which are provided as-is. Will probably be using this.
* [MAGICK.CSS](https://css.winterveil.net) ([src](https://github.com/wintermute-cell/magick.css))  
    A classless CSS framework that's styled after LaTeX documents (among others) and looks like a scientific document. Pretty cool.
* [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com)  
    A pretty old resource, with open source Bootstrap themes. People keep saying all Bootstrap sites look the same, but I think these themes show that you can pretty easily customize Bootstrap to look different.
* [Foundation templates](https://get.foundation/templates.html) & [Building Block Kits](https://get.foundation/building-blocks/kits.html)  
    I don't use Foundation itself, but these templates provide a general structure that's actually pretty easy to translate into any other CSS framework.
