            Really nice romantic story. I actually only realized part-way that this was my second time reading it, but it was a nice novel to re-read anyway.

            A cute healing story about a little girl who runs away from her abusive village and disovers the rest of the world. Not an isekai, for the most part.

            Another pretty good season of one of my favorite light novel series. They didn't quite get the awesomeness of the fight scene in the final episode, though.

            Another good volume. This is the first isekai novel (I know of) to give the past memories a small downside; what if a bunch of stuff was actually different from Earth? My favorite joke is 'eggs' actually being a kind of fruit.

            Main game finished. Like the original game, a nice casual platformer. I might enjoy this game more than the original Klonoa because it focuses more on puzzles.

            Mixed feelings about this one. One the one hand, the novel has a pretty interesting concept; multiple reincarnated people is not completely original, but it's still pretty rare. On the other hand, nothing actually really happens in the novel. My prediction for the next volume is that Laura turns out to be reincarnated too.

            Mixed feelings about this one too. The plot is pretty interesting and the main story is actually really good, but the romance subplot feels creepy. Not sure if I'm reading the next volume.

            Still a pretty interesting novel. It's the last part that was adapted for the anime so I already knew what was going to happen, but the light novel goes more into the motivations of the characters.

            This is the first post-anime novel and still a pretty interesting series. The first two-thirds of the book is about a play so it's really surprising when the plot suddenly takes off at the end.

            The original game was already the pinnacle of classic turn-based RPG's, and Royal adds even more cool features on top of that. The only gripes I have with the game is that I'm not too fond of Mementos and I don't like the Velvet Room alarm system.

            Pretty cool story. It's fun to have heroes come back from retirement and see how their age hasn't slowed them down. You also don't see many light novels with 'older' characters.

            Another amazing volume. Even the unlikable character gets likable in this volume, and a new villain is introduced. The main plot point introduced in the first novel is already taken care of so I wonder what the next volume is going to be about.

            Super Mario Wonder is a really fun game. In terms of game design, it's interesting to see a game where every level has its own gimmick that basically isn't reused anywhere else in the game.

            Like the previous volume, this one has a lot of lore. Other than that, there are some scenes of the heroines acting all jealous. The ending might surprise you: of course it ends with a harem instead of the protagonist picking someone. Kind of a low note to end on.

            This one is a mixed bag. On the one hand, the story is somewhat interesting with good world-building and it's one of the first isekai novels where the origin world is not Earth. On the other hand, I think the protagonist is pretty boring.

            It was my first time playing it and I can really see why so many people like it. Most of the game was really great, although I didn't like any of the platforming sections because the isometric perspective doesn't mesh well with platforming. I love the quirky games that result when Nintendo lets other companies use their characters.

            An interesting volume; at first it seemed like the novel would just introduce a new character and go with that, but then they suddenly used those new characters as an excuse to turn the novel into a travel story. I generally like travel stories because it allows for good world-building, so I'm looking forward to future volumes.

            Pretty fun isekai novel. Instead of having a great superpower, the protagonist's powers are basically a bit of modern knowledge and being a nice person. The novel starts out with a bit of high society and then becomes a strategy and tower defense story.

            Pretty fun novel. It's one of those novels where the protagonist doesn't know his own power. It's pretty entertaining overall, although I do think the protagonist constantly proclaiming how old and weak he is gets grating at times.

          I have conflicting feelings about this one. On the one hand, it's a cool revenge story about a powerful protagonist building a new life. On the other hand, it's also a harem comedy, which is a genre I really don't like. The novel is good enough for the annoying parts to not matter that much, though.

            Despite hearing on Reddit that the game is bad, I enjoyed it a lot. The story is really interesting and I'm glad it wraps up all of the remaining plot holes from the first two games. All of the new characters are pretty likable to the point that even the mass murderer is sort of redeemed at the end. One tip for people who play the game: don't forget to read the epilogue files at the end.

          The ongoing adventures of Inglis in the ice world. The whole volume is about a single villain, like the other volumes, but a pretty interesting one that involves some pretty nice world building. The novel also ends on one heck of a cliffhanger.

          The first half of the novel is more world-building and a bunch of slice of life, with the occassional fight against a dragon. The second half, however, has the return of an old villain and it is a lot of fun. This volume also ends with a crazy cliff-hanger and the plot seems to pick up speed.

          In this volume, the war has begun. We finally get to see Rafael's artifact powers, and a new challenger is introduced along with his Hieral Menace. All in all, this volume has a lot of suspense and high-stakes action. The volume doesn't end with a cliff-hanger per se, but it's clear what the plot is leading up to.

            Wonderful game. Gameplay-wise, it's okay. The gameplay is pretty simple and the controls were pretty finicky at times. However, the story was great. It's an incredible shounen "Power of Friendship" story, and it has a bunch of cool plot twists.

            The final volume of the current arc. This volume is mostly battle scenes, ending with a phenomenal climactic fight against the Prismer using several Hieral Menaces. Not much else to say about this volume, although the epilogue does tie up some loose ends.

            Pretty fun novel. It constantly reminded me of Silent Witch, but with a more confident heroine. That said, she's also one of those protagonists that doesn't know their own ability and constantly looks down on herself. The story is pretty cool and the characters are both fun and relatively believable.

            It's been a while since I've read Dahlia, so I forgot how well this series is written. It reads more like a real romance novel than most light novels. The volume was also really amazing. It still has quite a few light-hearted moments but it also has an incredibly dramatic story this time, and there is some great resolution and character development. The extra stories also show more of what I think could be the series' final villain.

            This volume was, as always, really well-written. This entire series reads more like proper novels than most light novels. Another recurring theme is that not that much actually happens. The volume has a lot of politics and interpersonal drama happening, but can mostly be boiled down to 'Dahlia invents kotatsu'.

            This was a difficult volume to get through at times. While the action pieces and slice of life scenes are generally pretty fun, I think it's really annoying that Noelle still keeps insisting that she's a worthless mage pretty regularly. And it's even jarring at times when she first acts confident and immediately flips to lacking confidence, as if the writer doesn't know what they want to do. The plot itself is still pretty fun, though.

            A cute detective novel involving a dog and a couple of elementary kids. The plot starts off really cute, and then gradually introduces more elements of the mystery before finishing with some very tense scenes. It's a pretty short novel, so I definitely recommend this novel to everyone.

            It's another one of those villainess isekai novels. This one is a cute travel story that feels like the isekai novel equivalent of Yuru Camp. It can also be considered a cooking novel, because the heroine always goes in-depth about the meals she makes. There are some action-y scenes but for the most part it's just a fun slice of life novel.

            Another great volume from my favorite series. Although this volume still has some great battle scenes, most of it is world building. In particular, we finally get to learn Teacher's backstory and how he got reincarnated as a sword. We also meet the other spirits in the sword, which is pretty cool.

            Time travel, in my isekai novel?! So far, it's just been hinted at, but it seems very interesting so far. Our heroes mainly spend time leaving the Granzell and exploring a new country. There are cute moments like Fran fishing or going to school for the first time, but also thrilling battles against powerful enemies. Also, Romeo is back, which causes several interesting plot threads.

            This was not the kind of novel that I expected. On the one hand, it does have a protagonist that suddenly gets incredibly powerful henchmen and just kind of does whatever he wants. However, this is only one-third of the story. The novel actually has two more protagonists: a young and mostly powerless girl who has to struggle to survive, and a charismatic Kirito-type who suddenly gets thrust into leading most of the players trapped in the game. The novel has quite a few tense moments and I definitely liked it.

            Really great Kirby game. I didn't really like the parts with motion controls, but other than that it was a delight to play like all the other Kirby games. The game is mostly pretty easy, except for the extra stages and the brutal final world.

            Pretty amazing first volume. It does a pretty good job with the game stuff and it feels like, the technological hurdles aside, an MMO that could really exist. The fights are exciting and the characters are likable for the most part. The world building is pretty interesting, and some big plot points are set up from the start.

            A great second volume. We learn a bit about Ray's backstory and more about the nature of the game. We also get to learn more about the machine nation, as a mech pilot temporarily joins the party. The action scenes in the novel are well-written and even though it's all 'just a game', it almost feels more like an isekai novel.

            This is one of my favorite Kirby games, as of now. At first, I felt like I was just playing Triple Deluxe again but the game gradually got more and more interesting. This game luckily has a lot less gyro sections, and instead brings back the amazing Kirby shmup sections. The robot suit itself is great and there are so many interesting things they do with it. All in all, an amazing game that any Kirby fan should play.

            Not a great novel. Not much actually happens in terms of plot, and there are a lot of sudden viewpoint changes without mentioning which character it changes to. The plot is basically one of those healing stories, where the heroine makes everyone around her happier, except this heroine is mute so her personality doesn't really shine through. Also counts as a cooking novel, because there are in fact several extended descriptions on how to make jam.

            Fun volume. About the same as the previous volumes; a lot of fun adventures with a likable cast of characters. The fox girl of last volume is added as a permanent member of the cast, although she doesn't really do much in this volume. Mell is also acting like a total idiot protagonist and not noticing Zara's feelings for her.

            Amazing game. This is one of the few games I would call just perfect. It's relaxing to play (except for the final level which is hell) and it oozes with charm in every way. The music is some of the best in any game I've ever played and I find myself still humming it from time to time. The gameplay is pretty simple but the game still has enough depth by hiding secrets everywhere so completionists beware.

            Alright game. The different stage types were a mixed bag: I wish some of them were an entire game, and for others I didn't have a great time. The game felt pretty unfocused because the gameplay kept being so different from stage to stage, and I didn't really feel like replaying the levels because there are a lot of (short) unskippable cutscenes. Not a game I would replay but nice for a single playthrough.

            Nice little adventure game. Nico is super cute, and all of the other characters are likable too. Gameplay-wise, it's pretty simple and it's mostly going from place to place and picking up all the items. The Solstice ending was also a really nice addition, and I can't imagine the game without the proper ending.

            Another pretty fun volume. Mostly a bunch of unrelated adventures, and general character development for every member of the squad. However, let's talk about the summary; not only does the event in the summary only happen two thirds into the novel but it happens completely differently from how it's described. Still a fun, cute novel though.

            While this novel started very slowly (and I almost stopped reading it halfway through chapter 2 or something), I'm happy I stuck with it because the novel got more interesting later on. This volume is mostly a romance and slice of life comedy, but the characters are pretty fun and interesting. Not that much intersting really happens in this volume, and it's mostly setup for later volumes.

            Another great novel. This is an interesting series because it's a departure from the pretty boy harem hero, and instead the hero is an older man with common sense. Beryl shows his skills in pretty ordinary ways, which makes him seem all the more amazing. This isn't a guy with super cheat powers but just a guy who is an amazing swordsman. Anyway, another fun character is introduced and Beryl gets involved in a whole political scandal which is pretty cool. The fight scenes are also pretty amazing. Also, the petite swordfighter girl gets a giant greatsword, which is a fantasy trope I really like.

            Fantastic game. It takes the original FFTA (which is also one of my favorites), fixes some of its problems and adds some new cool features on top. The story is also pretty interesting, although like the first game it's a bit 'childish'. They also brought in some of the new races from the other Ivalice games and it adds some more variety to your party.

            As I hoped, it's better than the anime version. However, it's still a pretty cliché superhero isekai novel. I would say it's outright bad, but it is pretty predictable and there wasn't anything really interesting. The thing that annoyed me most was that the protagonist constantly grinned and smirked all the time.

            What an amazing volume, with so much happening. The migrating dragon season has come again, and this time Sara joins basically every single major character in the capital. Sara is a proper apothecary now, and Allen becomes Sara's personal guard. There is a really cool fight in this volume, where the limits of Sara's barrier are tested. All in all, the best volume since the first two.

            You know those novels where a noble lady is banished by the prince, goes to another country and then turns out to be a wonderful person who makes everything around her better? This is not that kind of novel: this one has a genuine villainess protagonist who screws over the people in her way and doesn't really shy away from harming innocent people. The middle of the novel is pretty generic but then the ending hits like a truck and leaves me wondering about what else will happen.

            This novel came out of nowhere and was absolutely fantastic. It reminded me of Marimite (one of my favorite light novel series) but with more focus on LGBTQ+ matters. This is, as far as I know, one the only light novels to actually treat those kinds of issues seriously and I highly recommend it.

            Still a slice of life cooking light novel. At certain points it seems like there will be some action scenes, but all of the tension immediately drops off after a scene. For example, they go through an entire dungeon but every time they come across a monster they just hit-and-run it. All in all, just a cute zero-tension slice of life novel.

            Another fun volume. It's finally time for the festival, but that's the least of what actually happens in this volume. The big plot in this volume is that Ivy starts getting involved with monsters leaving their tamers because of mistreatment. The other really import plot is the further development of Ivy and Druid's relationship. Finally, we get to see more of Ivy's sister, and learn what happened to her family after Ivy left.

            Another great volume with two plot threads. One is the ever-present Dahlia inventing something extremely handy and everyone scrambles to prepare the manufacturing. The other plot is a very emotional arc that revolves around Marcella and his noble family. At the end, we also finally start seeing a resolution to the main romantic pairing (Dahlia and Volf). Small side-note for people who care, but this volume has a single paragraph of extremely pro-LGBT messaging.

            The first spin-off of Dahlia, and a pretty good first volume. Instead of the original series, which revolves around Dahlia and her toolmaking as well as her relationship with Volf, this series is a collection of "cases" where Lucia creates clothing for people and mostly changes their life for the better. It's a fun and pretty emotional volume, and I really liked it.

            Amazing volume. As far as I can tell this is the final volume, and it's a really great one to round of the series. Every character we've been introduced to appears, and we get to see their growth compared to the earlier volumes. The main plot of the volume is a giant monster that takes every other character to deal with, and we see the limits of the Invited tested as they deal with a monster that's impervious to their powers.

            First of all, this is a gender swap story, so it has that going for it. That aside, this was a really enthralling novel. It starts out pretty simple, hitting every cliche for a reincarnation story and some really cute moments between the MC and dragon mom. However, it starts picking up steam and the story gets really interesting and emotional.

            I don't generally review Anime and I don't think light novels are automatically better than their anime version, but this one in particular is different. The anime feels incredibly rushed compared to the novels, and anyone who likes the anime at all owes it to themselves to try the novels. The novels have so much more interpersonal relationship fluff and go in-depth about all of the crafting.

            Still a great puzzle platformer series. Better than the first GBA game in basically every way, and still pretty casual although some of the puzzles in the final world had me stumped for a bit. Also a pretty good story, and fun characters both old and new.

            Playing this game after the sequel was an interesting experience. The game is a lot of fun, with a great battle system and very fun shounen-style story. I love the Monster Hunter games and this one lets you craft all of the wonderfully designed weapons and armor, as well as form a party with all of your favorite (gen 4 and earlier) monsters of the series. On the other hand, I spent the entire time while playing this game thinking about all of the great additions of the sequel. The sequel is one of my favorite games of all time, and it sort of ruined my experience of this game.
